## FAQ
**Q: Why is a 32-bit version of Rift Explorer missing?**

A: We have never supported 32-bit versions of Rift Explorer and will never provide support nor downloads for 32-bit versions, 
However it can be built from source but as said previously no support will be given if an issue arises.
Any issues relating to 32-bit versions of Rift Explorer will simply be closed.
